# Airport-Talk
Continuing stories from Seattle-Tacoma International Airport.

"People keep coming into the Airport looking for Cory and we keep killing them and stealing their aircraft. We put a pilot in the jet who can fly and we send them back. Half the time, people are too afraid to say anything or our pilot kills them. The other half of the time we have to send people out to their base to control the situation. That's what happened at Pensacola. It was too good of an opportunity to not steal sailors organs so I did that. Now there [are] a hundred new men on that base and they have no idea how many people we really killed. When they showed up they thought a couple of people died and we were witnesses. We killed the whole base and wore their uniforms and then called the police and said they were criminals. The police really have to believe it because we keep killing their officers and no one suspects a thing. I had a cop come to me last night and snuggle up like the base could protect her. I sold organs from three of her friends before she called the police. She is the police?" -Morgan Gleaves.

"One time I took Olivia's mother Mikail for a flight. She stole the flight suit of my gunner snoopy." -DCMN HOFSTAD
